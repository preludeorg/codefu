# Refactoring

"Refactoring is a systematic process of improving code without creating new functionality that can transform a mess into clean code and simple design."

## Code Smells

"Code smells" are components or structures of a code base that don't seem correct; i.e. they "smell bad". There are a variety of different code smells you should be on the look out for:

* Bloaters
* Object-Orientation Abusers
* Change preventers
* Dispensables
* Couplers

## Why look for code smell?

Allowing code smells to linger for too long will cause your code base to slowly degrade over time. It will become more and more difficult to maintain the code base. How many teams have you been on where they have to completely rebuild the application after 2-3 years?
